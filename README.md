# Sanguine (tentative title)

Sanguine is a computer game in development by Born For Joy.
It is a remake of the classic game Snake. 
It is an attempt to see through to completion a managable project.
It's called Sanguine because 'anguine' is latin for snake and Sanguine is a cool
word. B)

## Feature Creep

  * teleport tiles
  * super food that has a time-limit on collection 
  * rotating background colour (every 2 ticks) and food that is dependant on 
    the background being a certain colour for it to be edible.
  * game mode where split snake parts carry on in the direction they're going 
    until they crash, and then they die and are removed.
  * game mode where split snake parts turn into food?
  * local multiplayer game mode (with WASD vs <-^->)
      - objective to get to certain length?
      - something like tron? but where can shoot other snake and eat their tail
